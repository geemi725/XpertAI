According to Shimy, lower ﬂammability limits of
hydrocarbons depend only upon the number of C at-oms in the chain, regardless of the number of H atomspresent. In contrast, the upper ﬂammability of hydro-carbons depends primarily on the number of H atomspresent in the chain. The formulas for the various HCand alcohols are given in Table 2 [23].

lower ﬂammability limit in air under atmospheric con-ditions by using the heat of oxidation as a parameter.The heat of oxidation represents the amount of heatenergy available for breaking each molecular oxygenbond required to initiate chain reactions with oxygen.In other words, it is the heat of combustion per mole ofoxygen consumed, /H9004H

Explosions blamed on the leakage of ﬂammable gas or vapor
may result in industrial losses and public catastrophe, such as
the gas explosions in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, which killed 32 and
injured 321 people in 2014 [1,2] . Gas and vapor can be ignited
and burned in the air only between the composition range of the
upper and lower ﬂammability limits, the UFL and LFL, respectively
[3,4] . Flammability limits are the properties most frequently used
in assessing the ﬂammability hazards of gases and vapors.","The study investigates the flammability limits of both organic and inorganic fuels, including esters, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. Experimental measurements and literature data were used to validate a proposed model, which accurately predicted temperature variations of flammability limits under adiabatic conditions. The model's applicability extends beyond organic fuels to include inorganic ones. The introduction highlights the significance of understanding flammability limits to prevent industrial accidents, referencing the 2014 gas explosions in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, which resulted in significant casualties and injuries.","REFERENCE:(Horng-Jang Liaw, Kuan-Yu Chen,2016,A model for predicting temperature effect on flammability limits)"
