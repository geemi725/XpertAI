Various molecular descriptors, including topological, charge, and geometric descriptors, are calculated to numerically represent the structural features of the compounds.

UPPER FLAMMABILITY LIMITS 
Upper flammability limits (UL) of hydrocarbons depend primarily on 
the number of hydrogen atoms present in the chain. The UL of all paraf-

are nearly alike. These formulas and samples of calculated values are 
shown in Table 2.

The ignition temperatm'es (IT) of all hydrocarbons in any group and 
of the alcohols depend on the number and bonding system of the carbon 
atoms and the degree of molecular freedom. The freer the molecules are 
in a group (higher translational speed), the higher the ignition temperatm'e
