1. Introduction
Explosions blamed on the leakage of ﬂammable gas or vapor
may result in industrial losses and public catastrophe, such as
the gas explosions in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, which killed 32 and
injured 321 people in 2014 [1,2] . Gas and vapor can be ignited
and burned in the air only between the composition range of the
upper and lower ﬂammability limits, the UFL and LFL, respectively
[3,4] . Flammability limits are the properties most frequently used
in assessing the ﬂammability hazards of gases and vapors.","The study investigates the flammability limits of both organic and inorganic fuels, including esters, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. Experimental measurements and literature data were used to validate a proposed model that predicts temperature variations of flammability limits under adiabatic conditions. The model demonstrated good predictive capability for both types of fuels. The importance of understanding flammability limits is underscored by their role in preventing industrial accidents, such as the 2014 gas explosions in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, which resulted in significant casualties and injuries.","REFERENCE:(Horng-Jang Liaw, Kuan-Yu Chen,2016,A model for predicting temperature effect on flammability limits)"
