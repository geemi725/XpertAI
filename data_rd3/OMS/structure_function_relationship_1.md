Understanding presence of open metal sites in MOFs:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- Metals Fraction
- Density of Solid
- Average Cationic Radius

#### Metals Fraction:
**Explanation**: The metals fraction in a metal-organic framework (MOF) can influence the presence of open metal sites (OMS) by determining the proportion of metal ions available for coordination. A higher metals fraction may increase the likelihood of creating coordinatively unsaturated sites, which are essential for forming OMS.

**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the role of metal ions in MOFs and their impact on adsorption properties and catalytic functions (Jacklyn N. Hall & Praveen Bollini, 2019; U¨lku¨ Ko¨kçam-Demir et al., 2020). The presence of metal ions and their coordination environment is crucial for the formation of OMS.

**Hypothesis**: A higher metals fraction in MOFs may lead to an increased number of open metal sites due to a greater availability of metal ions for coordination and potential removal of labile ligands.

#### Density of Solid:
**Explanation**: The density of a solid MOF can affect the presence of open metal sites by influencing the structural integrity and porosity of the framework. A denser MOF may have fewer voids and less porosity, potentially reducing the number of accessible OMS.

**Scientific Evidence**: The documents highlight the importance of maintaining the structural integrity and porosity of MOFs when modifying metal ions to create OMS (U¨lku¨ Ko¨kçam-Demir et al., 2020). The density of the solid framework is a factor in preserving these properties.

**Hypothesis**: A lower density of solid in MOFs may facilitate the formation of open metal sites by allowing more space for coordination and maintaining porosity.

#### Average Cationic Radius:
**Explanation**: The average cationic radius can impact the presence of open metal sites by affecting the coordination environment and stability of the metal ions within the MOF. Larger cationic radii may lead to less stable coordination, potentially increasing the number of OMS.

**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the role of ionic radius in determining the stability and coordination of metal ions in MOFs (Sara Abednatanzi et al., 2019). Variations in ionic radius can influence the formation of OMS.

**Hypothesis**: A larger average cationic radius may promote the formation of open metal sites by destabilizing the coordination environment and facilitating the removal of ligands.

### Summary
The features identified by XAI analysis—metals fraction, density of solid, and average cationic radius—are all potentially impactful on the presence of open metal sites in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The metals fraction influences the availability of metal ions for coordination, which is crucial for forming OMS. The density of the solid affects the structural integrity and porosity, which are important for maintaining accessible OMS. The average cationic radius impacts the stability and coordination environment of metal ions, potentially affecting the formation of OMS. While the documents do not explicitly state the relationship between these features and OMS, they provide insights into related factors that can be used to hypothesize these relationships.
