In summary, by combining experimental efforts with theoretical

2(dhtp). In this series,
we found the H 2binding following the trend of “Zn2+<Mn2+<
Mg2+<Co2+<Ni2+”. Our results suggest that the relative
strength of interaction of M2+-H2may be empirically predicted
by the ionic radius of the cations in same coordination environment.
This may provide a convenient guideline for the future developmentof MOFs with unsaturated metal sites.
