The study of the influence of the nature of the metal cations in
MOFs is a question that has been raised, from the very early
days of the field. There has thus been a large computational
eﬀort to address it, for example by systematic studies of the
structure and properties of series of isoreticular MOFs with
varying metal cations, such as M-IRMOF1 (M = Zn, Cd, Be, Mg,
Ca, Sr, Ba).77,78One of these studies, by Widom et al. ,77was to
our knowledge the first to discuss, in addition to the various
monometallic IRMOF-1 variants, the eﬀect of doping a frame-
