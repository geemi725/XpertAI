This method utilizes the fraction of water that adsorbs irreversibly at room temperature as an indicator of open-metal site density. The results from this method show quantitative agreement with those obtained from H2O adsorption isotherms, suggesting its broad applicability across different metals and anions. The method's validity is further supported by comparison with infrared (IR) spectroscopy data, which confirms site counts through the analysis of dehydration and dehydroxylation events in the hydroxyl-version of MIL-100(Cr). This approach leverages the universal nature of irreversible water chemisorption onto coordinatively unsaturated metal sites.","REFERENCE:(Jacklyn N.
