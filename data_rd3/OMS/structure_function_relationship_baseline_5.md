Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials composed of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic ligands. The presence of open metal sites (OMS) in MOFs is a critical feature that can significantly influence their properties and applications, such as gas storage, catalysis, and sensing. The presence and accessibility of these OMS can be altered by various molecular features, including the choice of metal ions, the design of organic ligands, and the overall framework topology. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these factors interplay:

### 1. Choice of Metal Ions
The type of metal ion used in the MOF synthesis can greatly influence the presence of OMS. Metals that can adopt multiple coordination geometries or have labile coordination sites are more likely to form MOFs with OMS. For example:
- **Transition Metals:** Metals like Cu(II), Fe(III), and Co(II) often form MOFs with OMS because they can easily lose coordinated solvent molecules or counterions, leaving behind unsaturated coordination sites.
- **Coordination Environment:** Metals with a preference for lower coordination numbers (e.g., Zn(II) often prefers tetrahedral coordination) can also lead to the formation of OMS when the coordination environment is partially unsaturated.

### 2. Design of Organic Ligands
The organic ligands used in MOF synthesis play a crucial role in determining the presence of OMS. Key aspects include:
- **Steric Bulk:** Bulky ligands can prevent full coordination around the metal center, leading to the formation of OMS. For example, ligands with large substituents can sterically hinder the coordination of additional ligands or solvent molecules.
- **Functional Groups:** Ligands with functional groups that can coordinate to metals in a bidentate or tridentate fashion can leave some coordination sites on the metal open. For instance, carboxylate groups often coordinate in a bridging mode, leaving other sites on the metal available.
- **Ligand Flexibility:** Flexible ligands can adapt to different coordination environments, potentially leading to the formation of OMS by not fully saturating the metal coordination sphere.

### 3. Framework Topology
The overall topology of the MOF, which is determined by the connectivity between metal nodes and organic linkers, can also influence the presence of OMS:
- **Connectivity and Dimensionality:** MOFs with lower connectivity (e.g., 3-connected or 4-connected nodes) are more likely to have OMS compared to those with higher connectivity (e.g., 6-connected or 8-connected nodes). Lower connectivity means fewer ligands are coordinating to each metal center, increasing the likelihood of OMS.
- **Porosity and Channel Size:** The size and shape of the pores and channels in the MOF can affect the accessibility of OMS. Larger pores and channels can facilitate the removal of coordinated solvent molecules, exposing OMS.

### 4. Post-Synthetic Modifications
Even after the initial synthesis, the presence of OMS can be altered through post-synthetic modifications:
- **Solvent Exchange and Activation:** Exchanging coordinated solvent molecules with less strongly coordinating solvents or removing them entirely through thermal activation can create OMS.
- **Chemical Treatments:** Treatments with acids, bases, or other reagents can selectively remove coordinated species, exposing OMS.

### Examples
- **HKUST-1 (Cu-BTC):** This MOF features Cu(II) paddlewheel units where each Cu(II) ion is coordinated to four carboxylate oxygen atoms from BTC (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) ligands, with the fifth coordination site occupied by a solvent molecule. Upon activation (removal of the solvent), the Cu(II) ions exhibit OMS.
- **MOF-74 (CPO-27):** This MOF contains metal ions (e.g., Mg, Ni, Co) coordinated to 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate ligands. The metal ions are in a distorted octahedral environment, with one coordination site occupied by a solvent molecule. Activation removes the solvent, creating OMS.

In summary, the presence of open metal sites in MOFs is intricately linked to the choice of metal ions, the design of organic ligands, and the overall framework topology. By carefully selecting and designing these molecular features, researchers can tailor the presence and accessibility of OMS to suit specific applications.
