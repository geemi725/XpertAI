Understanding toxicity of small molecules:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- Presence of a heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms (Phosphate Group)
- Presence of a tertiary amine
- Presence of a carbon-oxygen single bond

#### Presence of a Heteroatom Bonded to Three Oxygen Atoms (Phosphate Group):
**Explanation**: The presence of a heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms, typically a phosphate group, is associated with the toxicity of small molecules. Phosphate groups are known to be involved in various biochemical processes and can influence the reactivity and stability of molecules, potentially leading to toxic effects.
**Scientific Evidence**: The study by de S치 et al. (2022) found that substructures enriched in toxic molecules for environmental endpoints predominantly contained combinations of phosphate, phosphorothioate, sulfur, phosphorus, and oxygen atoms, indicating a link between these groups and toxicity (de S치 et al., 2022).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of phosphate groups in small molecules may contribute to their toxicity by altering their chemical reactivity and interaction with biological systems, potentially leading to adverse effects.

#### Presence of a Tertiary Amine:
**Explanation**: Tertiary amines are organic compounds that contain a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms. They are known to participate in various chemical reactions and can influence the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of compounds.
**Scientific Evidence**: The XAI analysis revealed a positive correlation between the presence of a tertiary amine and its SHAP values, suggesting a potential impact on toxicity (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: Tertiary amines may contribute to the toxicity of small molecules by affecting their metabolic stability and interaction with biological targets, leading to toxicological outcomes.

#### Presence of a Carbon-Oxygen Single Bond:
**Explanation**: Carbon-oxygen single bonds are common in organic molecules and can be found in various functional groups such as alcohols, ethers, and esters. These bonds can influence the solubility, reactivity, and overall toxicity of compounds.
**Scientific Evidence**: The XAI analysis indicated a positive correlation between the presence of a carbon-oxygen single bond and its SHAP values, suggesting an association with toxicity (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of carbon-oxygen single bonds in small molecules may contribute to their toxicity by affecting their chemical stability and interaction with biological systems, potentially leading to adverse effects.

### Summary
The analysis of features identified by XAI in relation to the toxicity of small molecules highlights the potential impact of specific chemical substructures. The presence of a heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms, typically a phosphate group, is associated with increased toxicity, likely due to its role in altering chemical reactivity and interaction with biological systems (de S치 et al., 2022). Tertiary amines, with their positive correlation to SHAP values, may influence toxicity through their effects on metabolic stability and interactions with biological targets (XpertAI, 2023). Similarly, carbon-oxygen single bonds, common in various functional groups, are linked to toxicity, possibly due to their impact on chemical stability and solubility (XpertAI, 2023). These findings suggest that specific chemical features can significantly influence the toxicity of small molecules, providing insights into the design and evaluation of safer chemical compounds.
