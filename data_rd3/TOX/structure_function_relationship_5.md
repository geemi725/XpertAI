Understanding toxicity of small molecules:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis

- Phosphate group
- Tertiary amine
- Carbon-oxygen single bond

#### Phosphate Group:
**Explanation**: The presence of a phosphate group, characterized by a heteroatom (phosphorus) bonded to three oxygen atoms, is associated with the toxicity of small molecules. Phosphate groups are often found in toxic substructures for environmental endpoints.
**Scientific Evidence**: The study by Alex G. C. de Sá et al. (2022) found that toxic molecules for environmental endpoints were significantly enriched with combinations of phosphate, phosphorothioate, sulfur, phosphorus, and oxygen atoms.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of phosphate groups in small molecules may contribute to their environmental toxicity due to their ability to form stable, reactive intermediates that can disrupt biological systems.

#### Tertiary Amine:
**Explanation**: Tertiary amines, which are nitrogen-containing groups, are associated with human-based toxic endpoints. These groups can participate in various biochemical interactions that may lead to toxicity.
**Scientific Evidence**: The study by Alex G. C. de Sá et al. (2022) indicated that toxic substructures for human-based endpoints were more enriched with nitrogen-containing groups, including tertiary amines.
**Hypothesis**: Tertiary amines may contribute to the toxicity of small molecules by interacting with biological targets, potentially leading to adverse effects in humans.

#### Carbon-Oxygen Single Bond:
**Explanation**: Carbon-oxygen single bonds, such as those found in ethers and alcohols, are frequently observed in toxic substructures. These bonds can influence the solubility and reactivity of molecules, affecting their toxicity.
**Scientific Evidence**: The study by Bhanushee Sharma et al. (2023) noted that oxygen-containing substructures, including ethers, were commonly associated with in vitro and in vivo toxicity predictions.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of carbon-oxygen single bonds in small molecules may enhance their ability to interact with biological systems, potentially leading to toxic effects.

### Summary
The relationship between specific chemical features and the toxicity of small molecules is complex and context-dependent. Phosphate groups are linked to environmental toxicity, likely due to their stability and reactivity. Tertiary amines are associated with human-based toxicity, possibly due to their interactions with biological targets. Carbon-oxygen single bonds, found in ethers and alcohols, are frequently observed in toxic substructures, suggesting their role in modulating the solubility and reactivity of toxic compounds. These features, identified through XAI analysis, highlight the importance of understanding chemical substructures in predicting and mitigating the toxicity of small molecules.
