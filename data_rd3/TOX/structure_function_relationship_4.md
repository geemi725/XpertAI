Understanding toxicity of small molecules:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis

- Sulfur bonded to oxygen atoms (SO)
- Phosphorus bonded to oxygen atoms (PO)
- Carbon-oxygen single bond

#### Sulfur bonded to oxygen atoms (SO):
**Explanation**: Sulfur bonded to oxygen atoms, such as in sulfate groups, is a common feature in various chemical compounds. These groups can influence the solubility and reactivity of molecules, potentially affecting their toxicity.
**Scientific Evidence**: The presence of sulfur and oxygen atoms in toxic molecules was noted to be enriched in environmental toxicity endpoints (de S치 et al., 2022).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of sulfur-oxygen bonds may contribute to the environmental toxicity of small molecules due to their potential to form reactive species or disrupt biological pathways.

#### Phosphorus bonded to oxygen atoms (PO):
**Explanation**: Phosphorus bonded to oxygen atoms, such as in phosphate groups, is crucial in biological systems. These groups can affect the toxicity of molecules by interacting with biological targets or altering metabolic pathways.
**Scientific Evidence**: Phosphate and phosphorothioate groups were found to be enriched in toxic substructures for environmental endpoints (de S치 et al., 2022).
**Hypothesis**: Phosphorus-oxygen bonds may contribute to the toxicity of small molecules by interfering with biological processes or forming toxic metabolites.

#### Carbon-oxygen single bond:
**Explanation**: Carbon-oxygen single bonds are prevalent in various functional groups, such as alcohols and ethers. These bonds can influence the polarity and reactivity of molecules, impacting their toxicity.
**Scientific Evidence**: Oxygen-containing substructures, including ethers and carbonyls, were frequently observed in toxic compounds (Sharma et al., 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of carbon-oxygen single bonds may enhance the toxicity of small molecules by increasing their reactivity or altering their interaction with biological targets.

### Summary
The analysis of features identified by XAI in relation to the toxicity of small molecules highlights the significance of heteroatoms bonded to oxygen atoms, such as sulfur and phosphorus, as well as carbon-oxygen single bonds. Sulfur-oxygen and phosphorus-oxygen bonds are associated with environmental toxicity, potentially due to their ability to form reactive species or disrupt biological pathways (de S치 et al., 2022). Carbon-oxygen single bonds, prevalent in various functional groups, may contribute to toxicity by influencing molecular reactivity and interactions with biological targets (Sharma et al., 2023). These features underscore the complex interplay between molecular structure and toxicity, necessitating further investigation to elucidate their precise roles in toxicological outcomes.
