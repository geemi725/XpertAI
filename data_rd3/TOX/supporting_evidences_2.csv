5. S−S, S−O, AND S −N BOND-FORMING ENZYMES
Whereas sulfur is an essential and ubiquitous component of
proteins in the form of cysteine and methionine, sulfur-heteroatom (S −X) bond containing natural products are
relatively scarce. A range of natural products with S −X bond
containing functional groups have been isolated from a varietyof sources, including plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals.
535
Although these natural products possess diverse carbon
scaﬀolds, their biological activities are often strongly associated
with the speci ﬁc chemical properties of the sulfur-containing
moieties. The biosynthetic logic for construction of S −X bonds
varies depending upon the speci ﬁc linkage, and the enzymes
involved in these transformations employ several di ﬀerent
cofactors to carry out this transformation. Here, we will discussthe biosynthesis of four sulfur-containing functional groups:disulﬁde-, sulfoxide-, sulfone-, and sulfate-containing natural","The text discusses the formation of sulfur-heteroatom (S−X) bonds in natural products, which are less common compared to sulfur's presence in proteins as cysteine and methionine. These S−X bond-containing compounds are found in various organisms, including plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals, and exhibit diverse carbon structures. Their biological activities are closely linked to the unique chemical properties of the sulfur-containing groups. The biosynthesis of these bonds involves different enzymes and cofactors, with specific methods depending on the type of linkage. The text specifically mentions the biosynthesis of four sulfur-containing functional groups: disulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, and sulfate.","REFERENCE:(Abraham J. Waldman, Tai L.
