least one bond aligned with the p-type oxygen lone pair. In the
following sections, we will show that this bond is often the
locus of chemical reactivity. Complexity of anomeric inter-actions increases with an increasing number of oxygenatoms. The constructive interplay of several eﬀects can leadto interesting reactivity consequences. In order to lay thefoundation for the more complex cases, we will start with thesimplest members of this functional group family – alcoholsand ethers.
Functional groups with one oxygen
In the classic anomeric systems ( e.g., acetals), the oxygen
lone pairs interact with relatively strong s-acceptors, i.e.,
the C–X bonds to electronegative heteroatoms. Conse-quences of such strong anomeric interactions are quiteobvious and have been well-recognized.

in the absence of additional heteroatoms, a single oxygenatom of an ether or an alcohol can influence structure and","The text discusses the alignment of bonds with the p-type oxygen lone pair, which often serves as a site for chemical reactivity. The complexity of anomeric interactions increases with more oxygen atoms, leading to significant reactivity outcomes. The article begins by examining simpler functional groups, such as alcohols and ethers, to establish a foundation for understanding more complex systems. In classic anomeric systems like acetals, oxygen lone pairs interact with strong sigma-acceptors, such as C–X bonds to electronegative heteroatoms, resulting in well-recognized consequences. Even without additional heteroatoms, a single oxygen atom in ethers or alcohols can still influence molecular structure.","REFERENCE:(Igor V. Alabugin, Leah Kuhn, Michael G. Medvedev, Nikolai V.
