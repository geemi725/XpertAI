Solubility prediction remains a critical challenge in drug development, synthetic route and

Here we report a successful approachto solubility prediction in organic solvents and water using a combination of machine learning(ANN, SVM, RF, ExtraTrees, Bagging and GP) and computational chemistry. Rational inter-pretation of dissolution process into a numerical problem led to a small set of selecteddescriptors and subsequent predictions which are independent of the applied machinelearning method.

Change degree of unsaturation reduce/increase by 2Add F or Me increase by 18 or 15M.A. Walker / Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 27 (2017) 5100–5108 5101","The text discusses strategies for modifying chemical compounds to alter their properties. It suggests removing unnecessary hydrophobic groups to enhance solubility, maintaining stereo- or regio-isomerism, and adjusting the degree of unsaturation by increasing or decreasing it by two units. Additionally, the text mentions that adding fluorine (F) or a methyl group (Me) can increase the molecular weight by 18 or 15 units, respectively.","REFERENCE:(Michael A.
