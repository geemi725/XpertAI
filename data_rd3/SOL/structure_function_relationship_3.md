Understanding solubility of small molecules:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- Atom at Aromatic/Non-Aromatic Boundary
- Two Heteroatoms Bonded to Each Other
- Atom Bonded to Three Heteroatoms

#### Atom at Aromatic/Non-Aromatic Boundary:
**Explanation**: This feature describes the presence of an atom located at the boundary between aromatic and non-aromatic regions. The SHAP analysis indicates a strong negative correlation with solubility, suggesting that such atoms may decrease solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis shows a correlation coefficient of -0.9531, indicating a strong negative impact on solubility (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of atoms at aromatic/non-aromatic boundaries may disrupt the uniformity of electron distribution, potentially reducing solubility due to decreased interaction with polar solvents.

#### Two Heteroatoms Bonded to Each Other:
**Explanation**: This feature involves two heteroatoms directly bonded, which also shows a strong negative correlation with solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis reports a correlation coefficient of -0.9688, indicating a significant negative impact on solubility (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The bonding of two heteroatoms might introduce steric hindrance or electronic effects that reduce solubility by affecting the molecule's ability to interact with water molecules.

#### Atom Bonded to Three Heteroatoms:
**Explanation**: This feature describes an atom bonded to three heteroatoms, which negatively correlates with solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis indicates a correlation coefficient of -0.9601, showing a strong negative impact on solubility (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: An atom bonded to three heteroatoms may create a highly polar region that could lead to aggregation or reduced solubility due to unfavorable interactions with water.

### Summary
The features identified by the XAI analysis, namely the presence of an atom at an aromatic/non-aromatic boundary, two heteroatoms bonded to each other, and an atom bonded to three heteroatoms, all show strong negative correlations with the solubility of small molecules. The SHAP analysis provides quantitative evidence of these relationships, with correlation coefficients indicating significant negative impacts on solubility (XpertAI, 2023). These features likely affect solubility through electronic and steric effects that hinder favorable interactions with water molecules. While the documents do not explicitly state these relationships, the SHAP analysis provides a clear indication of their impact. Further research could explore the mechanistic basis of these effects, potentially leading to strategies for modifying molecular structures to enhance solubility.
