Understanding solubility of small molecules:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis

- Atom at Aromatic/Non-Aromatic Boundary
- Atom with Three Heteroatom Neighbors

#### Atom at Aromatic/Non-Aromatic Boundary:
**Explanation**: The presence of an atom at an aromatic/non-aromatic boundary can influence the solubility of small molecules by affecting the molecule's electronic distribution and intermolecular interactions. Aromatic systems often contribute to hydrophobicity, while non-aromatic regions may introduce polar characteristics, potentially enhancing solubility in polar solvents like water.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the role of aromaticity in solubility, noting that removing aromaticity can enhance aqueous solubility (Ishikawa & Hashimoto, 2011). This suggests that the boundary between aromatic and non-aromatic regions could be significant in modulating solubility.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of an atom at an aromatic/non-aromatic boundary may enhance solubility by balancing hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, facilitating better solvation in aqueous environments.

#### Atom with Three Heteroatom Neighbors:
**Explanation**: An atom with three heteroatom neighbors is likely to be highly polar, which can significantly impact solubility. Polar atoms and groups can form hydrogen bonds with water, enhancing solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents highlight the importance of polar interactions and hydrogen bonding in solubility (Lipinski et al., 1997). The presence of multiple heteroatoms can increase the potential for such interactions, thereby improving solubility.
**Hypothesis**: An atom with three heteroatom neighbors may increase solubility by providing multiple sites for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions with water molecules.

### Summary
The features identified by the XAI analysis, namely the presence of an atom at an aromatic/non-aromatic boundary and an atom with three heteroatom neighbors, are both related to the solubility of small molecules through their influence on molecular polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. The aromatic/non-aromatic boundary can modulate the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, potentially enhancing solubility in polar solvents. Meanwhile, an atom with three heteroatom neighbors is likely to increase solubility by providing multiple sites for hydrogen bonding, a critical factor in aqueous solubility. These relationships are supported by the scientific literature, which emphasizes the role of aromaticity, polarity, and hydrogen bonding in solubility (Ishikawa & Hashimoto, 2011; Lipinski et al., 1997).
