better crystal packing. The increase in log Passociated with satu-
rating a carbocyclic-aryl might be offset by a reduction in melting
point.
This is interesting given the conclusions of the empirical studies
mentioned above which suggest that increasing Fsp3 yields
improved solubility. However, since the effect of unsaturation on
solubility is context dependent, this would suggest that the results
of these studies are biased by the make-up of the compounds in
the data sets. This seems plausible since, heterocycles make up a
large portion of the compounds encountered in medicinal chem-
istry. As seen in the next section, the observations in these studies
most likely reﬂect the properties of the heteroatoms contained
within these molecules. However, since phenyl is one of the most
commonly encountered rings found in drug-like molecules50the
modiﬁcations described in the current section should prove useful.","The text discusses the relationship between the structure of aromatic compounds and their physical properties, such as melting points and solubility. Aromatic compounds generally have higher melting points due to better crystal packing. Saturating a carbocyclic-aryl can increase log P but may reduce the melting point.

Change degree of unsaturation reduce/increase by 2Add F or Me increase by 18 or 15M.A. Walker / Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 27 (2017) 5100–5108 5101","The text discusses strategies for modifying chemical compounds to alter their properties. It suggests removing unnecessary hydrophobic groups to enhance solubility, maintaining stereo- or regio-isomerism, and adjusting the degree of unsaturation by increasing or decreasing it by two units. Additionally, the text mentions that adding fluorine (F) or a methyl group (Me) can increase the molecular weight by 18 or 15 units, respectively.","REFERENCE:(Michael A.
