amine. Numerous other substitutions are possible. In most cases
these modiﬁcations alter the core-template of the molecule and
as such can have an impact on drug binding. In order to avoid this
issue, an alternative approach (method b) is to attach a polar or
ionizable solubilizing appendage to the molecule. In a majority of
cases this is a basic nitrogen containing group but it can also be
a carboxylic acid or neutral-polar moiety. The appendage is
attached to a site on the molecule which does not bind to the target
and which, theoretically should not interfere with afﬁnity. This","The text describes two methods for modifying the structure of molecules to potentially enhance drug binding.

Next, we examined how the predicted solubility values and attention scores change when some atoms (e.g., 
O and N) of the molecules are replaced with others (e.g., C).
In Fig.  4a, we changed NH in methyl hydrazine (CH 3(NH)NH 2 ) to CH 2 . In the analysis of Klopman et al.19, 
the solubility contribution value of CH x is lower than those of OH, O, NH, and NH 2 . Thus, in this case, we can 
observe the predicted solubility values were diminished than that of methyl hydrazine. Specifically, the target 
value of methyl hydrazine was 1.34 (logS), and the water solubility derived by MoGAT was 1.339 before the 
replacement, but after the replacement, it decreased to 0.409. In addition, the attention score of the replaced 
atom was also decreased. In Fig.  4b, OH in cyclohexanol (C 6H12 O) was replaced with CH 3 , becoming methylcy-
clohexane (C 7H14 ).

Similarly, replacing OH with CH₃ in cyclohexanol (C₆H₁₂O) to form methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) led to a decrease in target solubility values from -0.44 to -3.85.
