replacing phenyl rings with heterocycles such as pyridine, or ali-

amine. Numerous other substitutions are possible. In most cases
these modiﬁcations alter the core-template of the molecule and
as such can have an impact on drug binding. In order to avoid this

ionizable solubilizing appendage to the molecule. In a majority of
cases this is a basic nitrogen containing group but it can also be
a carboxylic acid or neutral-polar moiety. The appendage is
attached to a site on the molecule which does not bind to the target
