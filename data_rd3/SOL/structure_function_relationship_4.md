Understanding solubility of small molecules:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- Atom at Aromatic Boundary
- Two Heteroatoms Bonded Together
- Atom with Three Heteroatom Neighbors

#### Atom at Aromatic Boundary:
**Explanation**: The presence of an atom at the boundary between aromatic and non-aromatic regions is negatively correlated with solubility. This feature likely affects the electronic distribution and steric factors, influencing solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis indicates a strong negative correlation with SHAP values (correlation coefficient: -0.9531) and an average impact of 0.4801 (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The transition between aromatic and non-aromatic regions may create a less favorable environment for solubility due to changes in electronic distribution and steric hindrance.

#### Two Heteroatoms Bonded Together:
**Explanation**: The presence of two heteroatoms bonded together is also negatively correlated with solubility. This could be due to the increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which might reduce solubility in non-polar solvents.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis shows a strong negative correlation with SHAP values (correlation coefficient: -0.9688) and an average impact of 0.3475 (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The increased polarity from heteroatom bonding may enhance interactions with polar solvents but reduce solubility in non-polar environments.

#### Atom with Three Heteroatom Neighbors:
**Explanation**: An atom with three heteroatom neighbors is negatively correlated with solubility. This feature might increase molecular complexity and polarity, affecting solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis indicates a strong negative correlation with SHAP values (correlation coefficient: -0.9601) and an average impact of 0.2489 (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of multiple heteroatom neighbors could increase the molecule's polarity and steric bulk, potentially reducing solubility in certain solvents.

### Summary
The features identified by the XAI analysis, such as the presence of an atom at an aromatic boundary, two heteroatoms bonded together, and an atom with three heteroatom neighbors, all show a strong negative correlation with solubility. These features likely influence solubility through changes in electronic distribution, polarity, and steric factors. The presence of heteroatoms and their arrangement can significantly affect the solubility of small molecules by altering their interaction with solvents. The SHAP analysis provides quantitative evidence of these correlations, suggesting that these structural features are critical in predicting solubility (XpertAI, 2023).
