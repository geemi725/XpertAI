- volume per atom
- symmetry_function_G
- unoccupied_energy_levels_CBM

#### volume per atom:
**Explanation**: The volume per atom in MOFs is directly related to the pore limiting diameter (PLD). A larger volume per atom generally indicates a more spacious framework, which can accommodate larger pores. Conversely, a smaller volume per atom suggests a denser framework with smaller pores.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the relationship between the volume per atom and the PLD, highlighting that the pore volume calculation is influenced by the probe size defined by the PLD, which varies for each material (Watanabe & Sholl, 2012). Additionally, it is noted that MOFs with smaller percent free volumes exhibit greater low-pressure adsorption, indicating a correlation between free volume and PLD (Parkes et al., 2013).
**Hypothesis**: Given the relationship between volume per atom and pore volume, it can be hypothesized that MOFs with larger volumes per atom will have larger PLDs, facilitating the diffusion of larger gas molecules.

#### symmetry_function_G:
**Explanation**: An explicit relationship between symmetry_function_G and the pore limiting diameter in MOFs was not found in the given documents.
**Scientific Evidence**: The provided documents do not discuss symmetry_function_G or its impact on the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.
**Hypothesis**: While the documents do not provide information on symmetry_function_G, it can be hypothesized that the symmetry of the framework could influence the uniformity and size of the pores. Symmetrical structures might lead to more uniform pore sizes, potentially affecting the PLD.

#### unoccupied_energy_levels_CBM:
**Explanation**: An explicit relationship between unoccupied_energy_levels_CBM and the pore limiting diameter in MOFs was not found in the given documents.
**Scientific Evidence**: The provided documents do not discuss unoccupied_energy_levels_CBM or its impact on the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.
**Hypothesis**: Although the documents do not provide direct information, it can be hypothesized that the electronic structure, including unoccupied energy levels, could influence the interaction between the framework and adsorbate molecules. This interaction might indirectly affect the effective pore size and PLD by altering the adsorption and diffusion properties.

#### Other Impactful Features:
**Explanation**: The documents discuss several other features that impact the pore limiting diameter in MOFs, such as the largest cavity diameter (LCD), surface area, and framework flexibility.
**Scientific Evidence**: 
- The relationship between the largest cavity size and the pore-limiting diameter is discussed, noting that in most MOFs, the largest cavity size is approximately 2.5 Å larger than the PLD (Haldoupis et al., 2010).
- Surface area calculations and their correlation with pore volume are highlighted, indicating that MOFs with negligible surface area have a PLD smaller than that of nitrogen (N₂) (Watanabe & Sholl, 2012).
- Framework flexibility and charge distribution within MOFs are mentioned as factors influencing molecular sieving behavior and CO2 separation (Hung et al., 2021).
**Hypothesis**: It can be hypothesized that the largest cavity diameter, surface area, and framework flexibility are significant factors influencing the PLD. Larger cavity diameters and higher surface areas likely correlate with larger PLDs, while flexible frameworks may exhibit variable PLDs depending on the external conditions and adsorbate interactions.

### Summary
The relationship between the features identified by XAI analysis and the pore limiting diameter (PLD) in MOFs can be summarized as follows:

- **Volume per atom**: There is a direct relationship between the volume per atom and the PLD. Larger volumes per atom generally indicate larger PLDs, facilitating the diffusion of larger gas molecules (Watanabe & Sholl, 2012; Parkes et al., 2013).
- **Symmetry_function_G**: An explicit relationship was not found in the given documents. However, it is hypothesized that the symmetry of the framework could influence the uniformity and size of the pores, potentially affecting the PLD.
- **Unoccupied_energy_levels_CBM**: An explicit relationship was not found in the given documents. It is hypothesized that the electronic structure, including unoccupied energy levels, could influence the interaction between the framework and adsorbate molecules, indirectly affecting the PLD.

Other impactful features discussed in the documents include the largest cavity diameter, surface area, and framework flexibility. These features are correlated with the PLD, with larger cavity diameters and higher surface areas likely leading to larger PLDs, while flexible frameworks may exhibit variable PLDs depending on external conditions and adsorbate interactions (Haldoupis et al., 2010; Watanabe & Sholl, 2012; Hung et al., 2021).
