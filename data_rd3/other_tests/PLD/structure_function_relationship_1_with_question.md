### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- volume_per_atom
- symmetry_function_G
- unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum

#### volume_per_atom:
**Explanation**: The volume per atom in a MOF can influence the pore limiting diameter (PLD) by affecting the overall density and spatial arrangement of the framework. A larger volume per atom could imply a more open structure, potentially leading to larger pore sizes and vice versa.
**Scientific Evidence**: The provided documents discuss the relationship between the volume per atom and pore limiting diameter in the context of gas adsorption properties. It is highlighted that within a given net topology, MOFs with smaller percent free volumes exhibit greater low-pressure adsorption, which indirectly suggests that the volume per atom is a significant factor in determining the PLD (Parkes et al., 2013).
**Hypothesis**: A higher volume per atom in MOFs likely correlates with larger pore limiting diameters due to the increased spatial separation between framework atoms, leading to more open structures.

#### symmetry_function_G:
**Explanation**: Symmetry functions, such as symmetry_function_G, are mathematical descriptors used to capture the local geometric and chemical environment around atoms in a material. These functions can influence the PLD by dictating the arrangement and connectivity of atoms within the MOF structure.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents do not explicitly mention symmetry_function_G. However, they discuss the complexity of analyzing pore structures in MOFs due to their diverse atomic species and geometries, which can be captured by symmetry functions (Haldoupis et al., 2010).
**Hypothesis**: Symmetry functions like symmetry_function_G likely impact the PLD by influencing the geometric arrangement and connectivity of atoms, thereby affecting the size and shape of the pores.

#### unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum:
**Explanation**: The unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum can affect the electronic properties of MOFs, which in turn can influence the interaction between the framework and adsorbate molecules. This interaction can impact the effective pore size and the PLD.
**Scientific Evidence**: The provided documents do not explicitly discuss the unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum in relation to the PLD. However, they do mention the importance of the electronic environment in determining adsorption properties, which can be related to the PLD (Hung et al., 2021).
**Hypothesis**: The unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum may influence the PLD by altering the electronic interactions between the framework and adsorbate molecules, potentially affecting the effective pore size.

### Other Impactful Features Correlated with the Pore Limiting Diameter in MOFs
The documents discuss several other features that are correlated with the pore limiting diameter in MOFs:

#### Free Volume:
**Explanation**: Free volume is the volume within the MOF that is not occupied by the framework atoms. It directly impacts the PLD as it determines the available space for adsorbate molecules to diffuse through the structure.
**Scientific Evidence**: The relationship between free volume and PLD is discussed in the context of gas adsorption properties. MOFs with smaller percent free volumes exhibit greater low-pressure adsorption, indicating that free volume is a significant factor in determining the PLD (Parkes et al., 2013).
**Hypothesis**: A larger free volume in MOFs likely correlates with larger pore limiting diameters due to the increased available space for adsorbate molecules.

#### Metal Center Identity:
**Explanation**: The identity of the metal center in MOFs can influence the PLD by affecting the coordination environment and the overall framework structure.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents mention that the metal center identity plays a role in gas adsorption properties, which can be related to the PLD (Parkes et al., 2013).
**Hypothesis**: Different metal centers in MOFs may lead to variations in the PLD due to differences in coordination environments and framework structures.

#### Presence of Open Metal Sites:
**Explanation**: Open metal sites in MOFs can provide additional adsorption sites for gas molecules, potentially affecting the effective pore size and the PLD.
**Scientific Evidence**: The presence of open metal sites is mentioned as a factor influencing gas adsorption properties, which can be related to the PLD (Parkes et al., 2013).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of open metal sites in MOFs may lead to variations in the PLD by providing additional adsorption sites and altering the effective pore size.

### Summary
The relationship between the features identified by XAI analysis and the pore limiting diameter (PLD) in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can be understood through various structural and electronic factors. The volume per atom influences the PLD by affecting the overall density and spatial arrangement of the framework. Symmetry functions like symmetry_function_G impact the PLD by dictating the geometric arrangement and connectivity of atoms. The unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum may influence the PLD by altering the electronic interactions between the framework and adsorbate molecules.

Other impactful features correlated with the PLD include free volume, metal center identity, and the presence of open metal sites. Free volume directly impacts the PLD by determining the available space for adsorbate molecules. The metal center identity and the presence of open metal sites influence the PLD by affecting the coordination environment and providing additional adsorption sites, respectively.

While the provided documents do not explicitly state the relationship between each feature and the PLD, they discuss synonymous features that allow for the generation of hypotheses based on the information provided.
