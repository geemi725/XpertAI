Understanding pore limiting diameter in MOFs:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- volume per atom
- symmetry_function_G
- unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum

#### Volume per Atom:
**Explanation**: The volume per atom in a MOF can influence the pore limiting diameter (PLD) by determining the overall density and spatial arrangement of the framework. A larger volume per atom could imply a more open structure, potentially leading to larger pore sizes.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the relationship between the volume per atom and the PLD in MOFs, highlighting that the pore volume calculation is influenced by the probe size defined by the PLD, which varies for each material (Watanabe & Sholl, 2012). Additionally, MOFs with smaller percent free volumes exhibit greater low-pressure adsorption, indicating a correlation between atomic volume and pore characteristics (Parkes et al., 2013).
**Hypothesis**: A larger volume per atom in MOFs may lead to larger pore limiting diameters due to a more open framework structure, which can accommodate larger probe sizes.

#### Symmetry_function_G:
**Explanation**: Symmetry functions, such as symmetry_function_G, are mathematical descriptors used to characterize the local environment around atoms in a material. These functions can influence the PLD by affecting the geometric arrangement and connectivity of the pores.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents do not explicitly mention symmetry_function_G but discuss the importance of geometric analysis and symmetry in determining pore structures in MOFs. For example, the use of symmetry arguments in structures like UiOs helps achieve high accuracy in determining pore centers and diameters (Trepte & Schwalbe, 2021).
**Hypothesis**: Symmetry functions like symmetry_function_G may impact the PLD by influencing the geometric arrangement and connectivity of the pores, leading to more accurate and efficient pore structure characterization.

#### Unoccupied Energy Levels Near the Conduction Band Minimum:
**Explanation**: The unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum can affect the electronic properties of MOFs, which in turn may influence the interaction between the framework and adsorbate molecules, potentially impacting the PLD.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents do not explicitly discuss the unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum in relation to the PLD. However, they highlight the importance of electronic properties, such as the identity of the metal center and the presence of open metal sites, in determining adsorption behavior (Parkes et al., 2013).
**Hypothesis**: The unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum may influence the PLD by affecting the electronic interactions between the MOF framework and adsorbate molecules, potentially altering the effective pore size.

### Other Impactful Features Correlated with the Pore Limiting Diameter in MOFs:
The documents discuss several other features that are correlated with the PLD in MOFs, including:
- **Kinetic Diameter of Adsorbate Molecules**: The kinetic diameter of molecules like CO₂ and N₂ is used to determine the suitability of MOFs for gas separation based on their PLD (Watanabe & Sholl, 2012).
- **Surface Area and Pore Volume**: The relationship between surface area, pore volume, and PLD is highlighted, with smaller probe sizes showing a clear correlation between surface area and pore volume (Watanabe & Sholl, 2012).
- **Diffusion Activation Energy**: The PLD is related to the diffusion activation energy for gases like CH₄, with significant activation energies observed for MOFs with PLDs between 2.2 and 3.6 Å (Haldoupis et al., 2010).

### Summary
The relationship between the features identified by XAI analysis and the pore limiting diameter (PLD) in MOFs can be summarized as follows:

- **Volume per Atom**: Larger volumes per atom may lead to larger PLDs due to a more open framework structure, which can accommodate larger probe sizes (Watanabe & Sholl, 2012; Parkes et al., 2013).
- **Symmetry_function_G**: Symmetry functions may impact the PLD by influencing the geometric arrangement and connectivity of the pores, leading to more accurate and efficient pore structure characterization (Trepte & Schwalbe, 2021).
- **Unoccupied Energy Levels Near the Conduction Band Minimum**: These energy levels may influence the PLD by affecting the electronic interactions between the MOF framework and adsorbate molecules, potentially altering the effective pore size (Parkes et al., 2013).

Other impactful features correlated with the PLD include the kinetic diameter of adsorbate molecules, surface area and pore volume, and diffusion activation energy. These features are crucial in determining the suitability of MOFs for gas separation and adsorption applications (Watanabe & Sholl, 2012; Haldoupis et al., 2010).
