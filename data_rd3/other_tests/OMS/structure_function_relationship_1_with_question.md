Understanding presence of open metal sites in MOFs:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- metals fraction
- density_of_solid
- average_cationic_radius

#### metals fraction:
**Explanation**: The fraction of metals in MOFs can influence the presence of open metal sites (OMS) by determining the availability of metal ions that can form coordinatively unsaturated sites. Higher metal fractions may provide more opportunities for creating OMS, which are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and enhancing the adsorption properties of MOFs.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss various methods for analyzing the presence and distribution of metals in MOFs, such as ATOFMS, XPS, and EDX, which help in determining the global metal concentrations and their homogeneity across crystallites (Abednatanzi et al., 2019). These techniques can indirectly suggest the potential for OMS formation based on metal distribution.
**Hypothesis**: A higher fraction of metals in MOFs is likely to increase the number of open metal sites, enhancing the material's adsorption and catalytic properties.

#### density_of_solid:
**Explanation**: The density of the solid MOF can affect the presence of open metal sites by influencing the framework's porosity and structural stability. A denser MOF may have less free volume for creating OMS, while a less dense MOF might be more prone to structural collapse if OMS are introduced.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents highlight the importance of maintaining the integrity, crystallinity, and porosity of MOFs when introducing OMS (Ko¨kçam-Demir et al., 2020). The density of the solid is indirectly related to these structural properties.
**Hypothesis**: MOFs with an optimal density that balances structural stability and porosity are more likely to support the presence of open metal sites without compromising the framework's integrity.

#### average_cationic_radius:
**Explanation**: The average cationic radius can influence the electronic structure and binding properties of the metal sites in MOFs. Metals with different cationic radii can affect the distance between adsorbaphores and the strength of interactions with guest molecules, thereby impacting the formation and effectiveness of OMS.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss how varying the metal ion can tune the distance between aromatic rings and enhance the MOF's stability and adsorption properties (Boyd et al., 2019). Additionally, the relationship between cationic radius and hydrogen adsorption in MOFs is explored, indicating that metals with different radii can significantly influence adsorption behavior (Yang & Zhong, 2006).
**Hypothesis**: The average cationic radius of the metal ions in MOFs is likely to affect the formation and functionality of open metal sites, with certain radii providing optimal conditions for enhanced adsorption and stability.

### Summary
The features identified by the XAI analysis—metals fraction, density_of_solid, and average_cationic_radius—are all impactful in determining the presence of open metal sites (OMS) in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The fraction of metals influences the availability of metal ions for creating OMS, while the density of the solid affects the framework's porosity and structural stability. The average cationic radius impacts the electronic structure and binding properties of the metal sites, thereby influencing the formation and effectiveness of OMS. These relationships are supported by various scientific studies and methods discussed in the provided documents, such as ATOFMS, XPS, EDX, and DFT calculations.
