### Relationship of Each Feature with the Presence of Open Metal Sites in MOFs

#### Metals Fraction:
**Explanation**: The fraction of metals in MOFs can influence the presence of open metal sites (OMS) because the type and amount of metal ions determine the coordination environment and the potential for creating coordinatively unsaturated sites.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the importance of metal ions in the formation of MOFs and their role in creating open metal sites. For example, the study by Abednatanzi et al. (2019) highlights the use of different metal cations in MOFs and their impact on the properties of the framework, which can include the formation of OMS.
**Hypothesis**: A higher fraction of metals that are prone to forming coordinatively unsaturated sites (e.g., transition metals) will likely increase the presence of OMS in MOFs.

#### Density of Solid:
**Explanation**: The density of the solid MOF material can affect the structural integrity and porosity, which in turn can influence the presence of open metal sites. A lower density might indicate a more porous structure, which could facilitate the formation of OMS.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents mention the importance of maintaining the structural integrity and porosity of MOFs when introducing OMS (Ko¨kçam-Demir et al., 2020). The density of the solid is indirectly related to these structural properties.
**Hypothesis**: MOFs with lower density are more likely to have a higher presence of open metal sites due to increased porosity and structural flexibility.

#### Average Cationic Radius:
**Explanation**: The average cationic radius can influence the coordination environment of the metal ions in MOFs. Larger cations may create more space around the metal centers, potentially leading to the formation of open metal sites.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents do not explicitly discuss the relationship between the average cationic radius and the presence of OMS. However, the study by Abednatanzi et al. (2019) discusses the impact of different metal cations on the properties of MOFs, which can be extrapolated to suggest that the size of the cations could influence the formation of OMS.
**Hypothesis**: MOFs with larger average cationic radii are more likely to have open metal sites due to the increased spatial allowance around the metal centers.

### Other Impactful Features Correlated with the Presence of Open Metal Sites in MOFs

#### Coordination Chemistry:
**Explanation**: The coordination chemistry of the metal ions in MOFs is crucial for the formation of open metal sites. The removal of labile ligands without damaging the framework is a key process in creating OMS.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents extensively discuss the role of coordination chemistry in the formation of OMS (Ko¨kçam-Demir et al., 2020; Hall & Bollini, 2020).
**Hypothesis**: The specific coordination environment and the ability to remove labile ligands without compromising the framework are critical for the presence of OMS in MOFs.

#### Structural Integrity and Porosity:
**Explanation**: Maintaining the structural integrity and porosity of MOFs is essential when introducing open metal sites. Any modification to the metal ions must preserve these properties to ensure the formation of OMS.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents emphasize the importance of preserving the network's crystallinity and porosity when creating OMS (Ko¨kçam-Demir et al., 2020).
**Hypothesis**: MOFs that maintain high structural integrity and porosity during modifications are more likely to have open metal sites.

### Summary
The presence of open metal sites (OMS) in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is influenced by several factors, including the fraction of metals, the density of the solid, and the average cationic radius. The fraction of metals determines the coordination environment and the potential for creating coordinatively unsaturated sites. The density of the solid affects the structural integrity and porosity, which are crucial for the formation of OMS. The average cationic radius influences the spatial allowance around the metal centers, potentially leading to the formation of OMS. Additionally, coordination chemistry and the ability to maintain structural integrity and porosity during modifications are critical for the presence of OMS in MOFs. These relationships are supported by various studies and scientific evidence from the provided documents.
