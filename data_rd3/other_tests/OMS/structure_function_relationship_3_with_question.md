#### Metals Fraction:
**Explanation**: The fraction of metals in MOFs can influence the presence of open metal sites (OMS) because the type and proportion of metal ions determine the coordination environment and the potential for creating coordinatively unsaturated sites.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the use of various metals in MOFs and their impact on properties such as gas adsorption and stability. For instance, the redox properties of metal sites within M-MOFs-74 influence their stability in humid conditions (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, the presence of different metals can affect the binding strength of adsorbates, as seen in the comparison of Ni-MOF-74 and [Ni₂(m-dobdc)] (Kökçam-Demir et al., 2020).
**Hypothesis**: The fraction of metals in MOFs is likely to affect the density and stability of open metal sites, as different metals have varying propensities to form and maintain OMS under different conditions.

#### Density of Solid:
**Explanation**: The density of the solid material in MOFs can influence the presence of open metal sites by affecting the overall structural integrity and porosity of the framework. Higher density materials may have less free volume for creating OMS.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents mention that maintaining the structural integrity and porosity of MOFs is crucial when creating OMS (Kökçam-Demir et al., 2020). Additionally, the density of solid materials is indirectly related to the stability and adsorption properties of MOFs, as seen in the study of hydrogen adsorption in different MOFs (Yang & Zhong, 2006).
**Hypothesis**: Higher density in MOFs may reduce the likelihood of forming open metal sites due to decreased free volume and potential structural constraints.

#### Average Cationic Radius:
**Explanation**: The average cationic radius can influence the presence of open metal sites by affecting the coordination environment and the ability of metal ions to form unsaturated sites. Larger cations may create more space for OMS, while smaller cations may lead to more tightly packed structures.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the impact of cationic radius on the adsorption properties of MOFs. For example, the study on MOF-505 shows that the average cationic radius affects hydrogen adsorption capacity (Yang & Zhong, 2006). Additionally, the replacement of In(iii) with Al(iii) in a MOF topology to achieve ideal adsorbaphore distance highlights the importance of cationic radius in MOF design (Boyd et al., 2019).
**Hypothesis**: The average cationic radius is likely to affect the formation and stability of open metal sites, with larger cations potentially facilitating the creation of OMS due to increased spatial accommodation.

### Summary
The features identified by the XAI analysis—metals fraction, density of solid, and average cationic radius—are all influential in determining the presence of open metal sites (OMS) in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The fraction of metals affects the coordination environment and stability of OMS, as different metals have varying propensities to form unsaturated sites. The density of the solid material influences the structural integrity and porosity, which are crucial for maintaining OMS. Lastly, the average cationic radius impacts the spatial arrangement and coordination environment, affecting the ability to create and maintain OMS. These relationships are supported by various studies discussed in the provided documents, highlighting the importance of these features in the design and functionality of MOFs.
