#### Metals Fraction:
**Explanation**: The fraction of metals in MOFs is crucial for the formation and presence of open metal sites (OMS). The type and proportion of metal ions directly influence the structural integrity and the ability to create coordinatively unsaturated sites.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the importance of maintaining the structural integrity, crystallinity, and porosity of MOFs when modifying metal ions to create OMS (Kökçam-Demir et al., 2020). Additionally, the homogeneity of metal distribution in MOFs, as analyzed by techniques like ATOFMS, XPS, and EDX, is essential for understanding the global metal concentrations and their impact on OMS (Abednatanzi et al., 2019).
**Hypothesis**: A higher fraction of specific metals that favor the formation of OMS, such as transition metals with suitable electronic configurations, will enhance the presence of OMS in MOFs.

#### Density of Solid:
**Explanation**: The density of the solid MOF material can influence the presence of OMS by affecting the overall porosity and structural stability of the framework. Higher density may correlate with more robust frameworks that can sustain the removal of labile ligands to create OMS.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents highlight the relationship between the density of solid MOFs and the presence of OMS, particularly in the context of hydrogen adsorption capabilities (Zhou et al., 2008). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations also support the idea that differences in electronic structure at OMS influence adsorption properties (Kökçam-Demir et al., 2020).
**Hypothesis**: MOFs with optimal density that balance structural stability and porosity are more likely to sustain the formation of OMS without compromising the framework integrity.

#### Average Cationic Radius:
**Explanation**: The average cationic radius of the metal ions in MOFs affects the coordination environment and the ability to create OMS. Smaller cations may lead to tighter coordination environments, while larger cations may facilitate the formation of OMS by creating more space for ligand removal.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the impact of the average cationic radius on the adsorption energy and the presence of OMS in MOFs, specifically in the context of hydrogen adsorption (Yang & Zhong, 2006). The study of MOF-505 shows that the adsorption energy near OMS is significantly higher, indicating the importance of cationic radius in creating effective OMS.
**Hypothesis**: MOFs with metal ions having an optimal average cationic radius that allows for the creation of coordinatively unsaturated sites without destabilizing the framework will exhibit a higher presence of OMS.

### Summary
The presence of open metal sites (OMS) in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is influenced by several key features, including the metals fraction, density of solid, and average cationic radius. The fraction of metals in MOFs is crucial as it determines the structural integrity and the ability to create OMS. Higher fractions of specific metals that favor OMS formation, such as transition metals with suitable electronic configurations, will enhance the presence of OMS (Kökçam-Demir et al., 2020; Abednatanzi et al., 2019). The density of the solid MOF material also plays a role, as optimal density balances structural stability and porosity, which are essential for sustaining OMS without compromising the framework (Zhou et al., 2008; Kökçam-Demir et al., 2020). Lastly, the average cationic radius affects the coordination environment and the ability to create OMS. MOFs with metal ions having an optimal average cationic radius that allows for the creation of coordinatively unsaturated sites without destabilizing the framework will exhibit a higher presence of OMS (Yang & Zhong, 2006).
