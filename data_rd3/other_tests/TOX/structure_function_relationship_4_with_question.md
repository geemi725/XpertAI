### Summary
The relationship between the identified features and the toxicity of small molecules can be understood through their influence on the molecule's reactivity, polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and interaction with biological targets. For instance, the presence of carbon-oxygen single bonds, heteroatoms bonded to three oxygen atoms, and various functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carboxyl, acetyl, thiol) can significantly affect the molecule's properties and its potential to form toxic metabolites. Additionally, the involvement of enzymes like P450 in the metabolism of these molecules can further contribute to their toxicity by generating reactive intermediates.
