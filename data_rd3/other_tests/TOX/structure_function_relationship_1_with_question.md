Understanding toxicity of small molecules:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- Heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms
- Carbon-oxygen single bond

### Feature Analysis

#### Heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms
**Explanation**: The presence of a heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms can significantly influence the chemical reactivity and biological activity of small molecules. Such structures are often found in functional groups like phosphates, sulfates, and borates, which can play critical roles in biochemical processes and potentially contribute to toxicity.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the presence of various heteroatoms in small molecules, including oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and boron, which are often linked to the biological activity and toxicity of these compounds (Delost et al., 2018). Additionally, the formation of heteroatom-heteroatom bonds (X−X, where X can be N, O, S, or P) is highlighted for their reactivity and diversity in natural products (Waldman et al., 2017).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of a heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms may contribute to the toxicity of small molecules by altering their chemical reactivity and interaction with biological targets, potentially leading to adverse effects.

#### Carbon-oxygen single bond
**Explanation**: Carbon-oxygen single bonds are common in various functional groups such as alcohols, ethers, and esters. These bonds can influence the solubility, reactivity, and metabolic stability of small molecules, which in turn can affect their toxicity.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents mention that oxygen-containing substructures, such as carbonyl groups, ketones, and ethers, are frequently observed in small molecules associated with toxicity predictions (Sharma et al., 2023). The presence of carbon-oxygen single bonds is also noted in the context of the chemical structures of compounds used in toxicity studies (Tonholo et al., 2020).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of carbon-oxygen single bonds in small molecules may contribute to their toxicity by affecting their metabolic stability and reactivity, leading to the formation of toxic metabolites or reactive intermediates.

### Summary
The features identified by the XAI analysis, namely the presence of a heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms and carbon-oxygen single bonds, are both significant in the context of small molecule toxicity. The presence of a heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms can alter the chemical reactivity and biological activity of small molecules, potentially leading to toxic effects. This is supported by the discussion of various heteroatoms in small molecules and their roles in biological activity and toxicity (Delost et al., 2018; Waldman et al., 2017). Similarly, carbon-oxygen single bonds are common in functional groups that influence the solubility, reactivity, and metabolic stability of small molecules, which can affect their toxicity (Sharma et al., 2023; Tonholo et al., 2020). These features are critical in understanding the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of small molecules and can guide the design of safer compounds.
