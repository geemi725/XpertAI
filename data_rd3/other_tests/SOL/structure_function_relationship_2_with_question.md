Understanding solubility of small molecules:
### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- Presence of an Atom at an Aromatic/Non-Aromatic Boundary
- Presence of Two Heteroatoms Bonded to Each Other
- Presence of an Atom with Three Heteroatom Neighbors

#### Presence of an Atom at an Aromatic/Non-Aromatic Boundary:
**Explanation**: This feature indicates the presence of an atom situated at the boundary between an aromatic and a non-aromatic region within a molecule. Such boundaries can influence the electronic distribution and steric factors, which in turn affect solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis shows a high negative correlation coefficient (-0.9531) with SHAP values and an average impact of 0.4801, indicating that this feature significantly impacts solubility predictions (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of an atom at an aromatic/non-aromatic boundary likely disrupts the π-electron system of the aromatic ring, potentially increasing solubility by reducing the molecule's overall hydrophobicity.

#### Presence of Two Heteroatoms Bonded to Each Other:
**Explanation**: This feature refers to the presence of two heteroatoms (atoms other than carbon and hydrogen) directly bonded to each other. Such configurations can introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities, which are crucial for solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis indicates a strong negative correlation coefficient (-0.9688) with SHAP values and an average impact of 0.3475, suggesting a significant influence on solubility (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of two heteroatoms bonded to each other increases the molecule's polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, thereby enhancing solubility.

#### Presence of an Atom with Three Heteroatom Neighbors:
**Explanation**: This feature describes an atom that is bonded to three heteroatoms. Such a configuration can significantly alter the electronic environment and increase the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis shows a high negative correlation coefficient (-0.9601) with SHAP values and an average impact of 0.2489, indicating a notable effect on solubility (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: An atom with three heteroatom neighbors likely increases the molecule's overall polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity, thereby improving solubility.

### Summary
The features identified by the XAI analysis—presence of an atom at an aromatic/non-aromatic boundary, presence of two heteroatoms bonded to each other, and presence of an atom with three heteroatom neighbors—are all significantly correlated with the solubility of small molecules. These features primarily influence solubility through their effects on molecular polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities.

1. **Presence of an Atom at an Aromatic/Non-Aromatic Boundary**: This feature disrupts the π-electron system of aromatic rings, potentially increasing solubility by reducing hydrophobicity (XpertAI, 2023).

2. **Presence of Two Heteroatoms Bonded to Each Other**: This configuration introduces polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities, enhancing solubility (XpertAI, 2023).

3. **Presence of an Atom with Three Heteroatom Neighbors**: This feature increases the molecule's overall polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity, thereby improving solubility (XpertAI, 2023).

These findings are supported by the SHAP analysis, which provides quantitative measures of the impact of these features on solubility predictions. The high negative correlation coefficients and average impacts indicate that these features are crucial for understanding and predicting the solubility of small molecules.
