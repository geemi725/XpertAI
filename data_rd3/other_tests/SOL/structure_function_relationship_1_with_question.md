### Features Identified by XAI Analysis
- Presence of an Atom at an Aromatic/Non-Aromatic Boundary
- Presence of Two Heteroatoms Bonded to Each Other
- Presence of an Atom with Three Heteroatom Neighbors

### Feature Analysis

#### Presence of an Atom at an Aromatic/Non-Aromatic Boundary:
**Explanation**: This feature indicates the presence of an atom that lies at the interface between aromatic and non-aromatic regions within a molecule. Such boundaries can influence the electronic distribution and steric factors, which in turn affect solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis shows a strong negative correlation (-0.9531) with SHAP values, indicating a significant impact on solubility predictions (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of an atom at an aromatic/non-aromatic boundary may disrupt the Ï€-electron system of the aromatic ring, potentially increasing solubility by reducing the molecule's overall hydrophobicity.

#### Presence of Two Heteroatoms Bonded to Each Other:
**Explanation**: This feature refers to the presence of two non-carbon atoms (heteroatoms) directly bonded to each other. Heteroatoms often introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities, which can enhance solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis indicates a strong negative correlation (-0.9688) with SHAP values, suggesting a significant influence on solubility (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The presence of two heteroatoms bonded to each other likely increases the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds with water, thereby enhancing solubility.

#### Presence of an Atom with Three Heteroatom Neighbors:
**Explanation**: This feature describes an atom that is bonded to three heteroatoms. Such configurations can significantly alter the electronic environment and increase the molecule's polarity.
**Scientific Evidence**: The SHAP analysis shows a strong negative correlation (-0.9601) with SHAP values, indicating a notable impact on solubility (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: An atom with three heteroatom neighbors likely increases the molecule's overall polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, thereby enhancing solubility.

### Additional Features Discussed in Documents

#### Rotatable Bonds:
**Explanation**: Rotatable bonds increase the flexibility of a molecule, which can influence its ability to interact with solvents.
**Scientific Evidence**: The document mentions that rotatable bonds are defined by the presence of certain substructures and are calculated using in-house programs (John S. Delaney, 2004).
**Hypothesis**: Increased flexibility due to rotatable bonds may enhance solubility by allowing the molecule to adopt conformations that are more favorable for interaction with water molecules.

#### Aromatic Proportion (AP):
**Explanation**: The proportion of aromatic atoms in a molecule can affect its hydrophobicity and, consequently, its solubility.
**Scientific Evidence**: The document states that AP is calculated using the Daylight SMARTS definition of aromatic atoms (John S. Delaney, 2004).
**Hypothesis**: A higher aromatic proportion may decrease solubility due to increased hydrophobicity, while a lower aromatic proportion may enhance solubility.

#### Non-Carbon Proportion:
**Explanation**: The proportion of non-carbon atoms in a molecule can influence its polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities.
**Scientific Evidence**: The document mentions that non-carbon proportion is identified using the SMARTS notation [!#6] (John S. Delaney, 2004).
**Hypothesis**: A higher proportion of non-carbon atoms likely increases solubility by enhancing the molecule's polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

### Summary
The features identified by the XAI analysis, such as the presence of an atom at an aromatic/non-aromatic boundary, the presence of two heteroatoms bonded to each other, and the presence of an atom with three heteroatom neighbors, all significantly impact the solubility of small molecules. These features generally increase the molecule's polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities, thereby enhancing solubility. Additional features like rotatable bonds, aromatic proportion, and non-carbon proportion also play crucial roles in determining solubility. Rotatable bonds increase molecular flexibility, aromatic proportion affects hydrophobicity, and non-carbon proportion enhances polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. These relationships are supported by scientific evidence from the provided documents, which highlight the importance of these molecular properties in solubility predictions.
