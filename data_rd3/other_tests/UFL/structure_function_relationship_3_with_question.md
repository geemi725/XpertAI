- Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Order)
- Dipole Moment

#### Structural Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Zero-Order)
**Explanation**: The Structural Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Zero-Order) is a molecular descriptor that quantifies the symmetry of a molecule's neighborhood at the zero-order level. This descriptor is used in QSPR models to predict various physicochemical properties, including the upper flammability limit (UFL) of organic molecules.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents suggest that this index is used in QSPR models to relate molecular structure to the UFL of organic molecules (Gharagheizi, 2009; Pan et al., 2009). The SHAP analysis indicates a high correlation coefficient (0.9189) with SHAP values, suggesting a significant impact on the model's predictions (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The Structural Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Zero-Order) likely captures essential structural features that influence the UFL, such as molecular symmetry and complexity, which affect how easily a molecule can ignite and sustain combustion.

#### Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Order)
**Explanation**: The Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Order) is a generalized form of the zero-order index, capturing the symmetry of a molecule's neighborhood at various orders. This descriptor is also used in QSPR models to predict the UFL of organic molecules.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents imply that this index is used in QSPR models to predict the UFL (Gharagheizi, 2010). The SHAP analysis shows a negative correlation coefficient (-0.8495) with SHAP values, indicating its influence on the model's predictions (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Order) likely captures higher-order structural features that influence the UFL, such as branching and connectivity, which affect the molecule's flammability characteristics.

#### Dipole Moment
**Explanation**: The dipole moment is a measure of the separation of positive and negative charges in a molecule. It influences the molecule's polarity and, consequently, its interactions with other molecules, which can affect its flammability.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the relationship between the dipole moment and the UFL, noting that it is one of the features used in predictive models (Seaton, 1991; Liaw & Chen, 2016). The SHAP analysis shows a negative correlation coefficient (-0.5881) with SHAP values, indicating its impact on the model's predictions (XpertAI, 2023).
**Hypothesis**: The dipole moment likely affects the UFL by influencing the molecule's intermolecular interactions and stability, which can alter its ignition and combustion properties.

### Summary
The features identified by the XAI analysis—Structural Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Zero-Order), Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Order), and Dipole Moment—are all significant predictors of the upper flammability limit (UFL) of organic molecules. The Structural Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Zero-Order) and Information Content Index (Neighborhood Symmetry of Order) capture essential structural features such as symmetry, complexity, branching, and connectivity, which influence how easily a molecule can ignite and sustain combustion. The dipole moment, on the other hand, affects the molecule's polarity and intermolecular interactions, which can alter its flammability characteristics. These features are used in QSPR models to predict the UFL, and their importance is supported by SHAP analysis, which quantifies their impact on the model's predictions.
