- Volume per Atom
- Symmetry Function G1: New Label
- Unoccupied Energy Levels Near Conduction Band Minimum

#### Volume per Atom:
**Explanation**: The volume per atom in a material can influence the pore structure, including the pore limiting diameter (PLD), as it affects the overall density and packing of the framework. A larger volume per atom might suggest a more open framework, potentially leading to larger pore sizes.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the importance of crystal density as a descriptor for differentiating MOF structures with the same molecular formula, indicating that variations in density (and thus volume per atom) can affect the atomic packing and pore characteristics (Chung et al., 2019).
**Hypothesis**: A higher volume per atom could correlate with larger pore limiting diameters in MOFs due to less dense packing, allowing for larger channels.

#### Symmetry Function G1: New Label
**Explanation**: Symmetry functions, such as G1, are often used in computational models to describe atomic environments. While the documents do not explicitly mention symmetry functions, they discuss the geometric and structural analysis of MOFs, which could be related to symmetry considerations.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents describe methods for characterizing MOF structures, including geometric analysis, which could implicitly involve symmetry considerations (Haldoupis et al., 2010).
**Hypothesis**: Symmetry functions like G1 might influence the pore limiting diameter by affecting the uniformity and regularity of the pore structure, potentially leading to more predictable and consistent pore sizes.

#### Unoccupied Energy Levels Near Conduction Band Minimum
**Explanation**: The unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum are typically related to electronic properties rather than structural ones. However, electronic properties can influence the stability and reactivity of MOFs, which might indirectly affect structural features like the pore limiting diameter.
**Scientific Evidence**: The documents do not explicitly link electronic properties to pore sizes but discuss the impact of structural changes on MOF properties (Choudhuri & Truhlar, 2020).
**Hypothesis**: While an explicit relationship was not found in the given documents, it is possible that electronic properties could influence the stability of the framework, indirectly affecting the pore limiting diameter.

### Summary
The relationship between the identified features and the pore limiting diameter in MOFs is not explicitly detailed in the provided documents. However, based on the information available, we can hypothesize that the volume per atom might correlate with the pore limiting diameter due to its influence on the density and packing of the framework. Symmetry functions, while not explicitly mentioned, could play a role in determining the regularity and uniformity of pore structures, potentially affecting the pore limiting diameter. The unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum are more related to electronic properties, and their direct impact on pore sizes is not clear from the documents. Overall, while the documents provide insights into the structural characterization of MOFs, they do not explicitly connect these features to the pore limiting diameter.
