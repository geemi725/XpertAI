#### Linker Length:
**Explanation**: The length of the organic linkers in MOFs directly affects the distance between metal nodes, thereby influencing the pore size. Longer linkers generally result in larger pore sizes, while shorter linkers lead to smaller pores.
**Hypothesis**: Increasing the length of the organic linkers will proportionally increase the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

#### Metal Node Size:
**Explanation**: The size of the metal nodes can also impact the pore limiting diameter. Larger metal nodes can create more spacious frameworks, while smaller nodes may result in tighter structures.
**Hypothesis**: Utilizing larger metal nodes will increase the pore limiting diameter, whereas smaller metal nodes will decrease it.

#### Functional Groups on Linkers:
**Explanation**: Functional groups attached to the linkers can either obstruct or facilitate the pore space. Bulky functional groups may reduce the effective pore diameter, while smaller or more flexible groups may have less impact.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of bulky functional groups on linkers will decrease the pore limiting diameter, while smaller functional groups will have a minimal effect.

#### Topology of the Framework:
**Explanation**: The overall topology or arrangement of the framework can significantly influence the pore size. Certain topologies may naturally create larger or smaller pores due to the spatial arrangement of the linkers and nodes.
**Hypothesis**: Frameworks with more open and less dense topologies will have larger pore limiting diameters compared to more compact and dense topologies.

#### Flexibility of the Framework:
**Explanation**: The flexibility of the MOF structure can allow for dynamic changes in pore size. Flexible frameworks can adapt to external stimuli, potentially altering the pore limiting diameter.
**Hypothesis**: More flexible frameworks will exhibit a wider range of pore limiting diameters under different conditions compared to rigid frameworks.

#### Presence of Defects:
**Explanation**: Defects in the MOF structure, such as missing linkers or nodes, can create additional pore space or alter the existing pore structure.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of defects will generally increase the pore limiting diameter due to the creation of additional voids.

#### Solvent Molecules in the Pores:
**Explanation**: Solvent molecules trapped within the pores can occupy space and effectively reduce the pore limiting diameter.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of solvent molecules within the pores will decrease the pore limiting diameter.

#### Coordination Geometry:
**Explanation**: The coordination geometry of the metal nodes can influence the spatial arrangement of the linkers and thus the pore size. Different geometries can lead to more open or more closed structures.
**Hypothesis**: Metal nodes with coordination geometries that promote more open structures will increase the pore limiting diameter.

#### Interpenetration:
**Explanation**: Interpenetration occurs when multiple frameworks interlock within the same crystal lattice, effectively reducing the available pore space.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of interpenetration will decrease the pore limiting diameter due to the overlapping of frameworks.

### Summary
The pore limiting diameter in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is influenced by a variety of molecular features. The length of the linkers and the size of the metal nodes are primary determinants, with longer linkers and larger nodes generally increasing the pore size. Functional groups on the linkers can either obstruct or facilitate pore space, with bulky groups reducing the effective diameter. The topology of the framework and its flexibility also play crucial roles, with more open topologies and flexible structures allowing for larger or variable pore sizes. Defects within the framework can create additional voids, increasing the pore diameter, while solvent molecules trapped in the pores can reduce it. The coordination geometry of the metal nodes and the presence of interpenetration further modulate the pore size, with more open geometries and lack of interpenetration favoring larger pores. Understanding these relationships is essential for the rational design of MOFs with desired pore characteristics.
