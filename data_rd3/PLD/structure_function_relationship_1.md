- Unoccupied Energy Levels Near Conduction Band Minimum

#### Volume per Atom:
**Explanation**: The volume per atom in a material can influence the pore limiting diameter (PLD) in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as it relates to the overall density and packing of the framework. A larger volume per atom might suggest a more open structure, potentially leading to larger pore sizes, including the PLD.

**Scientific Evidence**: The documents discuss the importance of crystal density as a descriptor for MOFs, which is related to the volume per atom. Variations in atomic packing, which are influenced by the volume per atom, can lead to different structural properties, including pore sizes (Chung et al., 2019).

**Hypothesis**: A higher volume per atom in MOFs could correlate with larger pore limiting diameters due to less dense atomic packing, allowing for larger cavities and channels.

#### Symmetry Function G1: A New Label
**Explanation**: Symmetry functions, such as G1, are often used in computational models to describe atomic environments. While the documents do not explicitly mention Symmetry Function G1, symmetry in general can affect the arrangement of atoms and thus the pore structure in MOFs.

**Scientific Evidence**: An explicit relationship was not found in the given documents. However, the documents discuss the geometric analysis of pore structures, which inherently involves symmetry considerations (Haldoupis et al., 2010).

**Hypothesis**: Symmetry functions like G1 could influence the pore limiting diameter by affecting the spatial arrangement of atoms, potentially leading to more uniform or irregular pore structures.

#### Unoccupied Energy Levels Near Conduction Band Minimum
**Explanation**: The unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum are related to the electronic properties of a material. While the documents do not directly link these energy levels to the pore limiting diameter, electronic properties can influence the stability and formation of MOFs, indirectly affecting pore sizes.

**Scientific Evidence**: An explicit relationship was not found in the given documents. The documents focus more on geometric and structural properties rather than electronic properties.

**Hypothesis**: The unoccupied energy levels near the conduction band minimum might affect the chemical stability and synthesis conditions of MOFs, which in turn could influence the pore limiting diameter.

### Summary
The relationship between the identified features and the pore limiting diameter in MOFs is not explicitly detailed in the provided documents. However, based on the information available, we can hypothesize that:

- **Volume per Atom**: This feature likely influences the pore limiting diameter by affecting the density and packing of the framework, with larger volumes per atom potentially leading to larger pore sizes (Chung et al., 2019).

- **Symmetry Function G1**: While not explicitly mentioned, symmetry functions could impact the arrangement of atoms and thus the pore structure, potentially affecting the pore limiting diameter (Haldoupis et al., 2010).

- **Unoccupied Energy Levels Near Conduction Band Minimum**: Although not directly linked in the documents, these energy levels might influence the stability and formation of MOFs, indirectly affecting pore sizes.

Overall, the documents emphasize the importance of geometric and structural properties in determining the pore limiting diameter, with less focus on electronic properties. Further research could explore the potential indirect effects of electronic features on pore structures.
