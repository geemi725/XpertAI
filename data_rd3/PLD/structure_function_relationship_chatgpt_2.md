#### Linker length:
**Explanation**: The length of the organic linkers in MOFs directly affects the distance between metal nodes, thereby influencing the pore size. Longer linkers generally result in larger pore sizes, while shorter linkers lead to smaller pores.
**Hypothesis**: Increasing the length of the linkers will increase the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

#### Linker rigidity:
**Explanation**: Rigid linkers tend to maintain a more open framework structure, which can lead to larger pore sizes. Flexible linkers, on the other hand, may collapse or bend, reducing the effective pore size.
**Hypothesis**: MOFs with more rigid linkers will have a larger pore limiting diameter compared to those with flexible linkers.

#### Metal node size:
**Explanation**: The size of the metal nodes can influence the overall structure and pore size of the MOF. Larger metal nodes can create more space within the framework, potentially increasing the pore size.
**Hypothesis**: Larger metal nodes will result in an increased pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

#### Functional groups on linkers:
**Explanation**: Functional groups attached to the linkers can either block or enhance the pore size depending on their size and nature. Bulky functional groups may reduce the pore size, while smaller or strategically placed functional groups may not significantly affect it.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of bulky functional groups on linkers will decrease the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

#### Topology of the framework:
**Explanation**: The overall topology or arrangement of the framework can significantly influence the pore size. Certain topologies may inherently support larger pores, while others may result in smaller, more restricted pores.
**Hypothesis**: MOFs with more open and less dense topologies will have a larger pore limiting diameter.

#### Solvent molecules in the pores:
**Explanation**: Solvent molecules present in the pores during synthesis can occupy space and reduce the effective pore size. The removal of these solvents can increase the pore size.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of solvent molecules in the pores will decrease the pore limiting diameter, but their removal will increase it.

#### Post-synthetic modifications:
**Explanation**: Post-synthetic modifications, such as the addition or removal of functional groups, can alter the pore size. These modifications can either increase or decrease the pore size depending on the nature of the changes.
**Hypothesis**: Post-synthetic modifications that remove bulky groups or add smaller groups will increase the pore limiting diameter.

#### Interpenetration:
**Explanation**: Interpenetration occurs when multiple frameworks interlock within the same crystal structure, reducing the available pore space. This generally leads to a decrease in pore size.
**Hypothesis**: Interpenetrated MOFs will have a smaller pore limiting diameter compared to non-interpenetrated MOFs.

#### Coordination geometry:
**Explanation**: The coordination geometry of the metal nodes can influence the spatial arrangement of the linkers and, consequently, the pore size. Certain geometries may promote larger pores, while others may restrict them.
**Hypothesis**: Metal nodes with coordination geometries that promote more open structures will result in a larger pore limiting diameter.

### Summary
The pore limiting diameter in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is influenced by a variety of molecular features. The length and rigidity of the linkers, the size of the metal nodes, and the presence of functional groups on the linkers all play crucial roles. Longer and more rigid linkers, as well as larger metal nodes, generally lead to larger pore sizes. Conversely, bulky functional groups and interpenetration tend to reduce the pore size. The topology of the framework and the coordination geometry of the metal nodes also significantly impact the pore size, with more open topologies and favorable geometries promoting larger pores. Solvent molecules present during synthesis can temporarily reduce pore size, but their removal can increase it. Post-synthetic modifications can either increase or decrease the pore size depending on the nature of the changes made.
