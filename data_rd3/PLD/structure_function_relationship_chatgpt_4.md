#### Linker length:
**Explanation**: The length of the organic linkers in MOFs directly affects the distance between metal nodes, thereby influencing the size of the pores. Longer linkers generally result in larger pore sizes, while shorter linkers lead to smaller pores.
**Hypothesis**: Increasing the length of the organic linkers will increase the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

#### Metal node size:
**Explanation**: The size of the metal nodes can also impact the pore limiting diameter. Larger metal nodes can reduce the available pore space, while smaller metal nodes can increase it.
**Hypothesis**: Utilizing smaller metal nodes will increase the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

#### Functional groups on linkers:
**Explanation**: Functional groups attached to the linkers can either block or expand the pore space depending on their size and orientation. Bulky functional groups can reduce the pore limiting diameter, while smaller or strategically oriented groups may have minimal impact.
**Hypothesis**: Introducing bulky functional groups on the linkers will decrease the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

#### Topology of the framework:
**Explanation**: The overall topology or geometric arrangement of the framework can significantly influence the pore structure. Certain topologies may naturally lead to larger or smaller pore sizes.
**Hypothesis**: Frameworks with more open and less dense topologies will have larger pore limiting diameters.

#### Flexibility of the framework:
**Explanation**: The flexibility of the MOF structure can allow for dynamic changes in pore size. Rigid frameworks maintain a consistent pore size, while flexible frameworks can adapt and change their pore sizes under different conditions.
**Hypothesis**: More flexible frameworks will exhibit variable pore limiting diameters depending on external conditions.

#### Presence of interpenetration:
**Explanation**: Interpenetration occurs when multiple frameworks interlock within the same crystal lattice, effectively reducing the available pore space. This can significantly decrease the pore limiting diameter.
**Hypothesis**: The presence of interpenetration will decrease the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

#### Solvent molecules in the pores:
**Explanation**: Solvent molecules trapped within the pores during synthesis can occupy space and reduce the effective pore size. The removal of these solvents can increase the pore limiting diameter.
**Hypothesis**: Removing solvent molecules from the pores will increase the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

#### Post-synthetic modifications:
**Explanation**: Post-synthetic modifications, such as the addition or removal of functional groups, can alter the pore size. These modifications can either increase or decrease the pore limiting diameter depending on the nature of the changes.
**Hypothesis**: Post-synthetic modifications that remove bulky groups or add smaller groups will increase the pore limiting diameter in MOFs.

### Summary
The pore limiting diameter in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is influenced by a variety of molecular features. The length of the linkers and the size of the metal nodes are primary determinants, with longer linkers and smaller metal nodes generally leading to larger pore sizes. Functional groups on the linkers can either block or expand the pore space, depending on their size and orientation. The topology of the framework also plays a crucial role, with more open structures typically having larger pores. Flexibility in the framework allows for dynamic changes in pore size, while interpenetration of multiple frameworks within the same lattice reduces the available pore space. Solvent molecules trapped in the pores during synthesis can decrease the effective pore size, but their removal can increase it. Finally, post-synthetic modifications can either increase or decrease the pore limiting diameter depending on the nature of the changes made.
