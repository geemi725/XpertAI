Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials composed of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic ligands, forming a crystalline structure with well-defined pores. The pore limiting diameter (PLD) is a critical property that determines the size of molecules that can enter or pass through the pores of the MOF. The PLD can be altered by manipulating various molecular features of the MOF. Hereâ€™s how different aspects of the molecular structure influence the PLD:

### 1. **Metal Nodes and Clusters:**
- **Size and Coordination Geometry:** The size and coordination geometry of the metal nodes or clusters can significantly influence the pore size. Larger metal clusters or those with more complex geometries can create larger pores.
- **Choice of Metal:** Different metals have different ionic radii and coordination preferences, which can affect the overall framework structure and, consequently, the pore size.

### 2. **Organic Linkers:**
- **Length and Rigidity:** The length and rigidity of the organic linkers play a crucial role. Longer linkers can span greater distances between metal nodes, leading to larger pores. Conversely, shorter linkers result in smaller pores. Rigid linkers tend to maintain a more open structure, while flexible linkers can lead to pore collapse or reduced pore size.
- **Functional Groups:** The presence of functional groups on the linkers can influence the pore size by either sterically hindering the pore space or by participating in additional interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) that can alter the framework geometry.

### 3. **Topology of the Framework:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The way in which metal nodes and organic linkers are connected (i.e., the topology of the framework) determines the overall pore structure. Highly connected networks (e.g., those with higher coordination numbers) can create more complex and potentially larger pore systems.
- **Interpenetration:** Some MOFs exhibit interpenetration, where multiple identical frameworks are interwoven. This can significantly reduce the effective pore size, as the interpenetrated networks occupy space within the pores.

### 4. **Post-Synthetic Modifications:**
- **Functionalization:** Post-synthetic functionalization of the MOF can introduce new functional groups into the pores, which can either increase or decrease the pore size depending on the nature of the modifications.
- **Guest Molecules:** The inclusion or removal of guest molecules (e.g., solvents, gases) within the pores can also alter the effective pore size. For example, the removal of templating agents used during synthesis can open up the pore structure.

### 5. **Framework Flexibility:**
- **Breathing MOFs:** Some MOFs exhibit flexibility, where the framework can expand or contract in response to external stimuli (e.g., pressure, temperature, guest molecule adsorption). This dynamic behavior can lead to changes in the pore size.

### 6. **Defects and Disorder:**
- **Defects:** The presence of defects within the MOF structure, such as missing linkers or nodes, can create additional pore space or alter the connectivity, thereby affecting the pore size.
- **Disorder:** Structural disorder, such as variations in linker orientation or incomplete crystallinity, can also impact the effective pore size.

### Summary:
The pore limiting diameter in MOFs is a tunable property that can be controlled through careful design and manipulation of the molecular features of the framework. By selecting appropriate metal nodes, organic linkers, and framework topologies, and by employing post-synthetic modifications, researchers can tailor the pore size to suit specific applications, such as gas storage, separation, catalysis, and drug delivery. Understanding the relationship between molecular structure and pore size is key to designing MOFs with desired properties.
