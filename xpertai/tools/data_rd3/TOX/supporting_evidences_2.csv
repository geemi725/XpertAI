"The label you provided seems to describe a chemical group where a heteroatom (an atom that is not carbon or hydrogen) is bonded to three oxygen atoms. Common examples of such groups include phosphate (PO₄³⁻), sulfate (SO₄²⁻), and nitrate (NO₃⁻).

Since the integer has no meaning and should be removed, let's consider the label without integers. For example, if the label was ""P3O4"", removing the integers would give ""PO"".

To rewrite this in a human interpretable manner, we need to identify the heteroatom and the general structure. Here are some common groups:

1. Phosphate group: PO₄³⁻
2. Sulfate group: SO₄²⁻
3. Nitrate group: NO₃⁻

Given the instruction to remove integers and rewrite the label, the new label should describe the group in a clear manner. Here are the rewritten labels for the examples:

1. ""PO"" could be interpreted as ""Phosphate group"".
2. ""SO"" could be interpreted as ""Sulfate group"".
3. ""NO"" could be interpreted as ""Nitrate group"".

So, the new label in a human interpretable manner would be:

**Phosphate group** (if the heteroatom is phosphorus)
**Sulfate group** (if the heteroatom is sulfur)
**Nitrate group** (if the heteroatom is nitrogen)

Please replace the heteroatom with the appropriate element based on the context of your label.","The model can be explained with the following SHAP analysis.Feature presence of a heteroatom bonded to three O has a correlation coefficient of  -0.9730490909057579 with its SHAP values.
