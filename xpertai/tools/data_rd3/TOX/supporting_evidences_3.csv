"Given the label presence of a heteroatom bonded to three O, the label without integers would be ""heteroatom bonded to three O"". 

Rewriting this in a human interpretable manner:

**New label:** Heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms","The model can be explained with the following SHAP analysis.Feature presence of a heteroatom bonded to three O has a correlation coefficient of  -0.9730490909057579 with its SHAP values. 
The average impact of presence of a heteroatom bonded to three O is 1.1380509894209032.
 Feature presence of a tertiary amine has a correlation coefficient of  0.7321885165158918 with its SHAP values. 
The average impact of presence of a tertiary amine is 0.11896651572457036.
 Feature Is a C-O single bond has a correlation coefficient of  0.7970382244919982 with its SHAP values. 
The average impact of Is a C-O single bond is 0.11502051382295993.","The SHAP analysis of the model reveals the following correlations and impacts of specific features:

1. The presence of a heteroatom bonded to three oxygen atoms has a strong negative correlation with its SHAP values (correlation coefficient: -0.9730) and an average impact of 1.1381.
2. The presence of a tertiary amine shows a positive correlation with its SHAP values (correlation coefficient: 0.7322) and an average impact of 0.1190.
3. The presence of a C-O single bond also has a positive correlation with its SHAP values (correlation coefficient: 0.7970) and an average impact of 0.1150.","REFERENCE:(XpertAI,2023,XAI Summary)"
